"use strict"  //treat all js code in new version 

// alert // it use to window pop it use to notification and another

console.log("akshay");

// datatye is a automatic defind for the the different value like
// for number we use int
// for alphabetic we use string
//null means standalone value it is a object type
// undefind no value we enter
//symbol => unique

//typeof is use for know the type of the data like akshay is a string for examle

console.log(typeof "aksahy");  // output is string

//if you want to value change in strng to number and any other we use Number(score) let see by the example

let score = "323"
//frist we check rist it score typeof after

console.log(typeof score); //output is string 

// we converst the score in number for 

let valueinNumber = Number(score)
console.log(typeof valueinNumber);  //output is typeof is number

//when we use the number plus alphabet output is Nan when convert it is in number so what happen let seea
//what is the typeof of Nan is let see


let scoreis = undefined
console.log(scoreis);
let valueinNumberis = Number(scoreis)
console.log( valueinNumberis); //output is NaN it means it convert into number and it convert is not in proper value is convert into NaN

//when we use  
//333abc is convert into number give output NaN
// use undefiend they give NaN
//we can convert into boolean its give output in number
// we can all the conversion in any datatype like string into number and via vera all datatype convert in any datatype
//we can convert number value in negative and positive
//for example
let value = 33
let negvalue = -value

console.log(negvalue); //output is -33

//let se when we use negative number and convert it into positive number so what the output is 

let isvalue = -44
let posisvalue = -isvalue

console.log(posisvalue); // output is in negative value like -44 and when we use the change negative value and negative value in both the side we found a positive value

//let see the operator in js

console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);

console.log(2*2);

console.log(2/2);


console.log(2%2); //check the output yourself

//let we see the when we use the string + string it output is string2
// let see by the example

let str1 = "akshay";
let str2 = "goyal"
let str3 = str1+str2
console.log(str3);  // output of this string sum is akshaygoyal

//last one thing is this when we use the frist "1"+6+6 its output is 166 its means if frist value is string it convert all the value in the string 
// and we use frist value is number is convert in the value some and string vlaue let se by the example


console.log("1"+6+5); //output is 165
console.log(1+6+"5");  //output is 75


//comparision

console.log(4>2);
console.log(4<2);
console.log(4==4);
// === what is use it, when we use the === it check datatype and then proivde output it like strict check
